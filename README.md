# MIT-6.858-Computer-Systems-Security

This repo contains the set of labs from the MIT 6.858 Computer Systems Security class which is available for free on [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-858-computer-systems-security-fall-2014/). Each lab has its own branch in this repo. I followed this online course independently in the fall of 2020 and completed the labs on my own VM.
